# Overview

The service is split in two separate workers for scalability and availability.

- Processor worker: handles production of notifications and accepts externally produced notifications.
- Inbox worker: serves the API to get user notifications and manages subscriptions for Server Sent Events.

The workers share a database to store the notifications and the subscribed users with their privacy configurations.

## Processor worker

This worker has two main responsibilities:
* Run the internal notification producers periodically to generate new notifications for events as they happen.
* Receive, validate and accept requests from external notification producers and store the notifications in the DB.

## Inbox worker

The worker in charge or retrieving the notifications to the user

### Use Case: Subscribe to notifications

Returns a stream of all the notifications

**Endpoint**
- `GET /notifications/events`
- Authentication: signed fetch, the user id will be inferred from the auth chain.

## Get notifications
- `GET /notifications?from=&size=&onlyUnread=true&limit=10`
- Authentication: signed fetch, the user id will be inferred from the auth chain.

Params:
- `from`: the timestamp of the event triggered the notification to filter the results from (this means all retrieved notifications will have a timestamp >= 
  from)
- `limit`: the number of items retrieved in the query, default 20 and max 50
- `onlyUnread`: if true, then only unread notifications will be retrieved. If false, notifications will not be filtered by the read status.

Return:

# Run locally

### Prerequisites

Please make sure to have a postgres DB running (locally, docker, any external provider).  You can quickly spin off a new Postgres instance using Docker using:

```
yarn rundb:local
```

### Run the service
Once the DB is up and running, set up the config in `.env`.

Finally, start the servers.

```
yarn
yarn start:local
```
